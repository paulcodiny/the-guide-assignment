# The Guide Assignment

In this repository you will find two code snippets:
- [javascript function](./src/handle-hook.js)
- [web-component build with Polymer](./src/builds-overview.html)

## How to use it

### Step 1 - fork
Create a fork before starting the assignment!

### Step 2 - review
Write your reviews inside the `*.md` files next to the `src` files

### Step 3 - refactor
Refactor the code and submit a `PR` into the main repository.

## Assignment
Your assignment is to do a code review, trying to identify as many problems as you can, alongside with possible solutions to it.

## Extra
If you feel like going extra mile, feel free to refactor this code, fixing those problems you've found.
